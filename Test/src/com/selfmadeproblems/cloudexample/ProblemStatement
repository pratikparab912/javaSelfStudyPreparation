There are four types of clouds: Cirrus, Cumulus, Stratus, and Nimbus. Each cloud has a height range
from land: 8000-12000 meters, 4000-8000 meters, 2000-4000 meters, and 0-2000 meters, respectively,
as listed above. Only Nimbus clouds have the ability to drop rain. I want to write a Java program
to display the number of clouds, then print the names of the clouds, then print the names of the clouds
with their ranges, and lastly, print that only Nimbus clouds have the ability to drop rain. I want to
use a HashMap with the key as the type of cloud and the value as its range.
