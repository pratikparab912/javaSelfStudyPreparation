1.Assignment Problem Statement: Inheritance and Dynamic Method Dispatch in Java
 
Scenario:
Imagine you are tasked with developing a payroll system for a company that employs different types of workers. The workers include Full-Time employees, Part-Time employees, and Contract employees. While all workers share some common attributes, such as employee ID, name, and basic salary, each type has unique attributes and methods specific to their employment.
 
Requirements:
 
1. Create a superclass called `Employee` with the following attributes:
   - Employee ID
   - Name
   - Basic Salary
 
2. Implement a method in the `Employee` class named `calculateSalary()`. This method will be overridden by the subclasses to calculate the salary based on the employment type.
 
3. Create three subclasses: `FullTimeEmployee`, `PartTimeEmployee`, and `ContractEmployee`, each extending the `Employee` class.
 
4. In each subclass, implement the `calculateSalary()` method to calculate the total salary based on their specific employment type:
   - For `FullTimeEmployee`: Basic Salary + Bonus
   - For `PartTimeEmployee`: Basic Salary * Hours Worked
   - For `ContractEmployee`: Basic Salary * Contract Duration
 
5. Use the `super` keyword to call the `calculateSalary()` method from the superclass in each subclass to include the common calculation for the basic salary.
 
6. Implement a class called `PayrollSystem` with a method named `processPayroll()`. This method will take individual `Employee` objects as parameters and dynamically dispatch the `calculateSalary()` method for each employee.
 
7. Demonstrate dynamic method dispatch by creating instances of different types of employees (FullTimeEmployee, PartTimeEmployee, and ContractEmployee) and invoking the `processPayroll()` method for each.
 
8. Display the details of each employee, including their specific attributes and the calculated salary.
 
By implementing this assignment, you will gain a practical understanding of inheritance, the use of the `super` keyword, and dynamic method dispatch in Java within the context of a real-world scenario.



2. Assignment Problem Statement: Abstract Class and Method in Java (Different Scenario)

1. Create an abstract class named `Animal` with the following attributes:
   - Age
   - Name
   - Sound

2. Declare an abstract method in the `Animal` class called `makeSound()`. This method will be implemented by the subclasses to define the specific sound each type of animal makes.

3. Create three subclasses: `Mammal`, `Bird`, and `Reptile`, each extending the `Animal` class.

4. In each subclass, implement the `makeSound()` method to simulate the unique sound of the specific type of animal:
   - For `Mammal`: Print a mammal-specific sound like "Roar" or "Chirp."
   - For `Bird`: Print a bird-specific sound like "Tweet" or "Squawk."
   - For `Reptile`: Print a reptile-specific sound like "Hiss" or "Growl."

5. Include appropriate constructors in each subclass to initialize the specific attributes of the animal.
